abstract: 'This study examines the often-overlooked epidemiology of Plasmodium ovale
  infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. P. ovale has received limited
  attention compared to P. falciparum and P. vivax, yet understanding its distribution
  and burden is important for comprehensive malaria control efforts.'
