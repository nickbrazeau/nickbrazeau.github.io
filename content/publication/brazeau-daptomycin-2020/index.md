abstract: 'Daptomycin exposure promotes irreversible loss of daptomycin susceptibility
  in clinical Staphylococcus epidermidis infection co-incident with an isolated single
  point mutation in WalK. This study demonstrates the rapid evolution of antimicrobial
  resistance in clinical settings and highlights the importance of evolutionary medicine
  in understanding treatment failures.'
