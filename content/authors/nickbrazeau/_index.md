I am an infectious diseases fellow at Duke University Hospital pursuing a PSTP fast-track. As an ID physician (trainee), I am interested in why some individuals experience more severe illness and how these differences shape transmission dynamics. I want to integrate these two fields to identify and disrupt the pathways that allow infections to spread within- and between-hosts.
