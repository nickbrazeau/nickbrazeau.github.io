I am an infectious diseases fellow at Duke University Hospital pursuing a PSTP fast-track. As a physician-scientist, I integrate molecular epidemiology, genomics, infectious disease dynamics, and ML/AI methods to understand transmission pathways, characterize antimicrobial resistance evolution, and identify points where within-host and between-host propagation can be disrupted.
