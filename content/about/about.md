Most people call me Nick.

I earned my bachelor’s degree in Human Evolutionary Biology from Harvard College, graduating *magna cum laude*. My undergraduate thesis on chimpanzee growth patterns—mentored by Zarin Machanda and Richard Wrangham—received *Highest Honors* and the Thomas T. Hoopes Prize. I then spent nine months in Uganda as a Fulbright Scholar with the [Kibale Chimpanzee Project](https://kibalechimpanzees.wordpress.com/), studying the Kanyawara chimpanzee community.

I joined the University of North Carolina’s Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD) and completed my PhD in Epidemiology at the Gillings School of Global Public Health. Working with Jonathan Juliano and the late [Steven Meshnick](https://www.astmh.org/blog/august-2020/in-memoriam-steven-meshnick,-md,-phd,-fastmh) in the [IDEEL@UNC](https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/infdis/ideel/) group, my dissertation focused on the molecular, spatial, and genetic epidemiology of malaria in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I also examined antimalarial drug resistance and malaria genetic relatedness. This work was supported by an [NIH F30 fellowship](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/9679726).

In 2020, I joined Imperial College London as a research associate and member of the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team. My work centered on Bayesian re-estimation of the infection fatality ratio under the mentorship of Robert Verity, Lucy Okell, Azra Ghani, and Neil Ferguson.

During the 2024–2025 medical residency interview season, I also served as a part-time research consultant on a Predictive Intelligence for Pandemic Prevention initiative with [TriCEM](https://tricem.org/). There, I explored how contact-network structure shapes pandemic predictability and evaluated AI/ML-driven agent-based epidemiological modeling approaches under the mentorship of David Rasmussen, Charlie Nunn, and Michael Emch.

I completed the MD/PhD program in 2023 and began residency at Duke University Hospital in the Physician-Scientist Training Program in Internal Medicine with subspecialty training in Infectious Diseases. I started my Infectious Diseases fellowship in July 2025, and I will complete an Internal Medicine Chief Residency year from July 2026 to June 2027.

Long-term, I plan to build a career as a physician-scientist focused on infectious disease dynamics—within- and between-host modeling—paired with pathogen genomics with in interest in global health. I aim to integrate computational modeling, molecular epidemiology, and emerging ML/AI tools to improve patient care, advance mechanistic understanding of infections, and reduce clinical disease burden.

Outside of clinical work and research, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, and traveling. I am a former wrestler and still (try to) train occasionally. Most of my athletic energy now goes toward keeping up with my wife, Katelyn Rittenhouse—an exceptional global women’s health researcher whose [work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q6IQT_kAAAAJ&hl=en) I highly recommend.
