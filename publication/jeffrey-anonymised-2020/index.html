Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths. Results: We show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister's announcement of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility. Conclusions: These analyses form a baseline from which to observe changes in behaviour in the UK as social distancing is eased and inform policy towards the future control of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK."><link rel=alternate hreflang=en-us href=https://nicholasbrazeau.com/publication/jeffrey-anonymised-2020/><meta name=theme-color content="#2962ff"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/academicons/1.8.6/css/academicons.min.css integrity="sha256-uFVgMKfistnJAfoCUQigIl+JfUaP47GrRKjf6CTPVmw=" crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=stylesheet href=https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.0/css/all.css integrity=sha384-aOkxzJ5uQz7WBObEZcHvV5JvRW3TUc2rNPA7pe3AwnsUohiw1Vj2Rgx2KSOkF5+h crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fancybox/3.2.5/jquery.fancybox.min.css integrity="sha256-ygkqlh3CYSUri3LhQxzdcm0n1EQvH2Y+U5S2idbLtxs=" crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.15.6/styles/darcula.min.css crossorigin=anonymous title=hl-light><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.15.6/styles/darcula.min.css crossorigin=anonymous title=hl-dark disabled><link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:400,700%7CRoboto:400,400italic,700%7CRoboto+Mono&display=swap"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/academic.min.0129a70d91b556bfeee60a2761ebcab2.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/academic.96c9d57f78edaefbed63fd2534fb6c17.css><link rel=manifest href=/index.webmanifest><link rel=icon type=image/png href=/img/icon-32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon type=image/png href=/img/icon-192.png><link rel=canonical href=https://nicholasbrazeau.com/publication/jeffrey-anonymised-2020/><meta property="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"><meta property="twitter:site" content="@NFBrazeau"><meta property="twitter:creator" content="@NFBrazeau"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nick Brazeau"><meta property="og:url" content="https://nicholasbrazeau.com/publication/jeffrey-anonymised-2020/"><meta property="og:title" content="Anonymised and aggregated crowd level mobility data from mobile phones suggests that initial compliance with COVID-19 social distancing interventions was high and geographically consistent across the UK | Nick Brazeau"><meta property="og:description" content="Background: Since early March 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic across the United Kingdom has led to a range of social distancing policies, which have resulted in reduced mobility across different regions.
