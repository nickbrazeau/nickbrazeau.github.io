When two parasites share large segments of identical DNA, it\u0026rsquo;s not coincidence—it\u0026rsquo;s evidence of recent common inheritance. This is Identity by Descent (IBD), and it\u0026rsquo;s revolutionizing how we understand malaria transmission.\nUnlike traditional surveillance that tracks where people get infected, IBD tracks where parasites came from. This molecular genealogy reveals:\nTransmission chains — Which infections are connected? Imported vs. local cases — Is this a new introduction or local transmission? Connectivity patterns — Which villages/regions exchange parasites? Elimination progress — Are we interrupting transmission or just suppressing it? Let\u0026rsquo;s explore how IBD works and why it matters for malaria control.\nIdentity by State vs. Identity by Descent Before diving into IBD, we need to understand a critical distinction:\nIdentity by State (IBS) IBS simply means \u0026ldquo;the alleles are the same.\u0026rdquo; Two parasites have IBS at a locus if they both have allele \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; at that position.\nIBS can occur through multiple mechanisms:\nCommon ancestry (they inherited \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; from a shared ancestor) Convergent evolution (both independently mutated to \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;) Random chance (allele \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; is common in the population) Selection (allele \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; provides fitness advantage) IBS is easy to measure but hard to interpret. Just because two parasites share an allele doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they\u0026rsquo;re closely related.\nIdentity by Descent (IBD) IBD means \u0026ldquo;the DNA was inherited from a recent common ancestor.\u0026rdquo; Two parasites have IBD if they both inherited the same copy of DNA from a shared ancestor—not just the same allele sequence, but the actual identical genetic material.\nIBD is difficult to measure (requires statistical models) but easy to interpret: High IBD = recent shared ancestry.\nThe Key Difference Imagine two people both have blue eyes (IBS). This could mean:\nThey\u0026rsquo;re siblings (IBD—inherited from same parents) They\u0026rsquo;re unrelated but blue eyes are common in their population (IBS, not IBD) IBD methods use patterns across the genome to distinguish these scenarios.\nWhy IBD Matters More Than IBS Consider a simple example with two malaria parasites:\nScenario 1: High IBS, Low IBD\n80% of alleles match Matches are scattered randomly across the genome Interpretation: The parasites are from the same geographic region but not closely related Scenario 2: High IBS, High IBD\n80% of alleles match Matches occur in long continuous blocks across chromosomes Interpretation: The parasites shared a recent common ancestor (within a few transmission cycles) The pattern matters more than the raw percentage. IBD looks for contiguous blocks of shared alleles, not just overall similarity.\nThe Biology Behind IBD IBD works because of recombination—the shuffling of genetic material during sexual reproduction in the mosquito.\nRecombination Breaks Down IBD When malaria parasites mate in a mosquito:\nTwo parent parasites exchange DNA through recombination This creates offspring with mosaic genomes—some segments from parent 1, some from parent 2 Over generations, recombination breaks up IBD segments The key insight: Recombination is clock-like\nRecent ancestry → Large IBD segments (few recombination events) Distant ancestry → Small/no IBD segments (many recombination events) The Time Scale IBD is exquisitely sensitive to recent transmission:\n1-2 transmission cycles ago: IBD segments span megabases (millions of basepairs) 5-10 transmission cycles: IBD segments shrink to kilobases \u0026gt;20 transmission cycles: IBD segments are too small to reliably detect This makes IBD perfect for tracking transmission over weeks to months—exactly the timescale relevant for outbreak response.\nMeasuring IBD: The HMM Approach The gold standard method for detecting IBD in malaria is hmmIBD (Hidden Markov Model for IBD), developed by Bob Verity and colleagues.\nThe Hidden Markov Model Framework hmmIBD treats the genome as a sequence of positions that are either:\nIBD (inherited from common ancestor) Not IBD (independent inheritance) The \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo; part: You can\u0026rsquo;t directly observe IBD status. You only observe whether alleles match (IBS).\nThe model asks: Given the observed pattern of matching/non-matching alleles, what\u0026rsquo;s the most likely sequence of IBD/non-IBD states along the chromosome?\nKey Inputs hmmIBD requires:\nGenetic data — SNP genotypes for parasite pairs Population allele frequencies — How common is each allele? Recombination rate — How fast does recombination break up IBD? The Logic At each position, the model calculates:\nIf IBD at this position:\nMatching alleles are very likely (inherited same segment) Non-matching alleles are rare (only if rare mutation occurred) If not IBD at this position:\nMatching alleles depend on population frequency (could match by chance) Non-matching alleles are common By comparing these probabilities across the genome, hmmIBD identifies long stretches that are more likely IBD than expected by chance.\nOutput: IBD Fraction hmmIBD reports an IBD fraction for each parasite pair:\nIBD = 0: No shared ancestry detected IBD = 0.5: Half the genome is IBD (sibling parasites or parent-offspring) IBD = 1.0: Entire genome is IBD (clones or nearly identical strains) IBD in Action: Use Cases 1. Reconstructing Transmission Chains The Problem: During an outbreak, public health teams need to know: Who infected whom?\nThe IBD Solution: High IBD (\u0026gt;0.8) between parasites from two people indicates direct transmission or transmission through a common intermediate within 1-2 cycles.\nReal Example: In a village outbreak in Eswatini:\nPerson A infected Week 1 Person B infected Week 3 IBD(A,B) = 0.92 Interpretation: Person B was likely infected directly from Person A or from someone A infected. This identified the transmission chain and guided contact tracing.\n2. Detecting Imported Cases The Problem: Is malaria resurgence due to local transmission or importation?\nThe IBD Solution: Compare new infections to circulating local strains:\nHigh IBD with local strains → Local transmission Low IBD with local strains → Importation Real Example: Zanzibar elimination program:\nMost new cases had IBD \u0026lt; 0.1 with existing cases High IBD with parasites from Tanzania mainland (150 km away) Conclusion: 80% of cases were imported, not local transmission Action: Shifted focus to border screening rather than local vector control 3. Measuring Connectivity Between Regions The Problem: Do two villages exchange parasites? At what rate?\nThe IBD Solution: High mean IBD between villages indicates frequent parasite flow.\nReal Example: DRC spatial analysis:\nVillage pairs \u0026lt;50 km apart: Mean IBD = 0.35 Village pairs \u0026gt;200 km apart: Mean IBD = 0.05 Interpretation: Most transmission is local (\u0026lt;50 km), but long-distance importation does occur Action: Targeted interventions in high-connectivity clusters 4. Elimination Monitoring The Problem: Are we interrupting transmission or just reducing cases?\nThe IBD Solution: Track IBD over time:\nRising IBD → Transmission becoming more clonal (fewer sources) Falling IBD → Transmission remains diverse (many sources) Real Example: Zambia MDA campaign:\nPre-intervention: Mean IBD = 0.15 (diverse transmission) Post-intervention: Mean IBD = 0.45 (clonal outbreaks from few remaining sources) Interpretation: Successfully interrupted most transmission, but pockets remain Action: Targeted mop-up in high-IBD clusters IBD vs. Other Relatedness Measures How does IBD compare to alternatives?\nMethod What it Measures Time Scale Best For IBD Shared ancestry via recombination 1-20 generations Transmission chains, importation F_ST Population differentiation 100s-1000s generations Geographic structure PCA Genetic similarity Varies Population structure visualization TMRCA Time to common ancestor Variable Evolutionary timescales Phylogeny Evolutionary relationships 100s-1000s generations Strain origins, drug resistance IBD\u0026rsquo;s sweet spot: Detecting relationships over weeks to months—the timescale of malaria control operations.\nTechnical Challenges Challenge 1: Complexity of Infection (COI) Most infections are polyclonal (multiple parasite strains). This creates ambiguity:\nWhich clone from person A matches which clone from person B? Is high IBD due to relatedness or just the same dominant clone? Solution: Methods like hmmIBD-MCMC probabilistically handle polyclonal infections by integrating over possible clone pairings.\nChallenge 2: Population Allele Frequencies IBD estimation requires accurate population allele frequencies. Using frequencies from the wrong population biases IBD estimates.\nSolution: Estimate frequencies from the same samples you\u0026rsquo;re analyzing, or use population-specific reference panels.\nChallenge 3: Low-Density SNP Panels IBD works best with whole-genome sequencing. But cost-effective panels use 50-200 SNPs—too sparse for traditional IBD.\nSolution: New methods like dEploid and Coil use probabilistic models to estimate IBD from sparse data by leveraging linkage information.\nChallenge 4: Recombination Rate Uncertainty IBD estimation requires knowing the recombination rate. But malaria recombination rates vary by region and are imprecisely measured.\nSolution: Sensitivity analyses across plausible recombination rates to ensure results are robust.\nThe IBD-Distance Relationship One of the most consistent findings in malaria genomics: IBD decays exponentially with geographic distance.\nThe relationship follows:\nIBD(d) = IBD_0 × exp(-d / L) Where:\nd = geographic distance between samples L = characteristic dispersal distance (typically 20-80 km) IBD_0 = baseline IBD at distance zero This relationship has profound implications:\nShort dispersal distance (L = 20 km):\nTransmission is highly localized Interventions can focus on small areas Elimination is feasible region-by-region Long dispersal distance (L = 80 km):\nParasites travel far (human migration, mosquito movement) Interventions must cover large areas Elimination requires coordinated regional efforts Real-World Variation Region Dispersal Distance (L) Interpretation Rural DRC 15-25 km Hyper-local transmission Zanzibar 40-60 km Moderate dispersal Southeast Asia 80-150 km High mobility (border crossings) IBD Network Analysis Modern IBD analysis treats relatedness as a network:\nNodes = individual infections Edges = high IBD connections (\u0026gt;0.5) Network metrics reveal transmission structure:\nClustering Coefficient High clustering → Tight transmission networks (local outbreaks) Low clustering → Diffuse transmission (importation-driven)\nCommunity Detection Algorithms like Louvain method identify transmission clusters—groups of highly connected infections.\nUse case: In a multi-village outbreak, community detection identified three independent transmission clusters. Targeted interventions in these clusters interrupted transmission faster than blanket approaches.\nNetwork Centrality High-centrality nodes = infections connected to many others Interpretation: Potential superspreaders or hubs in transmission network\nThe Future: Real-Time IBD Surveillance Current research is pushing toward operational IBD surveillance:\nPortable Sequencing Oxford Nanopore MinION enables:\nField-deployable sequencing Results within 24 hours Immediate IBD-based outbreak response Automated Pipelines Software like IBD-pipeline and malariaibdR automate:\nVCF processing IBD calculation Network visualization Report generation Integration with Case Data Linking IBD networks with:\nCase GPS coordinates Travel history Intervention coverage Environmental data Vision: Real-time transmission network dashboards guiding intervention deployment.\nWhat We\u0026rsquo;ve Learned From a decade of IBD research in malaria, key insights have emerged:\n1. Most Transmission is Local IBD consistently shows:\n60-80% of transmission occurs \u0026lt;10 km from source Super-spreaders are rare Transmission chains are short (2-4 hops) Implication: Reactive case detection within 500m-1km of index cases is effective.\n2. Importation Drives Resurgence In pre-elimination settings:\n50-90% of new cases show low IBD with local strains Importation overwhelms local transmission Implication: Border screening and treatment of travelers is critical for elimination.\n3. IBD Tracks Interventions IBD responds faster than case counts to interventions:\nMass drug administration: IBD increases within weeks Indoor residual spraying: IBD decreases over months Implication: IBD provides early feedback on intervention effectiveness.\n4. Elimination Requires Regional Coordination High IBD across regions demonstrates:\nParasites don\u0026rsquo;t respect administrative boundaries Isolated elimination efforts are vulnerable to reimportation Implication: Coordination at \u0026gt;100 km scales is essential.\nThe Bottom Line Identity by descent transforms malaria genomic data from a population-level snapshot into a transmission-level movie. By tracing shared ancestry, IBD reveals:\nWho infected whom Where parasites came from Which villages are connected Whether elimination is progressing As sequencing costs decline and field-deployable platforms mature, IBD surveillance is transitioning from research tool to operational capability.\nThe future of malaria elimination won\u0026rsquo;t just count cases—it will map transmission networks in real-time and target interventions at the precise locations where transmission persists.\nIBD gives us the resolution to see transmission at its finest scale: the links between individual infections. And in those links lie the keys to elimination.\nFurther Reading Key Papers:\nVerity R, et al.

That single mosquito bite might be transmitting one parasite strain—or five, or ten distinct genetic clones simultaneously.\nComplexity of Infection (COI) is the number of genetically distinct malaria parasite clones present in a single infection. Understanding COI is crucial for:\nTransmission intensity assessment — High COI indicates high transmission Drug resistance monitoring — Polyclonal infections complicate resistance detection Vaccine evaluation — Multiple strains can confound efficacy estimates Elimination strategies — Low COI suggests transmission can be interrupted But measuring COI is surprisingly challenging. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore how we do it and why it matters.\nMonoclonal vs. Polyclonal Infections Monoclonal Infections (COI = 1) A monoclonal infection contains a single parasite clone. This occurs when:\nTransmission intensity is low (few infectious mosquitoes) The infected person has limited exposure Previous infections have been cleared From a genetic perspective, a monoclonal infection is \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo;—you\u0026rsquo;re sequencing DNA from one parasite genome. Any genetic variation you observe is sequencing error, not biological complexity.\nPolyclonal Infections (COI \u0026gt; 1) A polyclonal infection contains multiple distinct clones. This happens through two mechanisms:\n1. Superinfection — The person is bitten by multiple infected mosquitoes over time, each delivering different parasite clones. This is the dominant mechanism in high-transmission settings.\n2. Cotransmission — A single mosquito carries and transmits multiple distinct clones simultaneously. This occurs when the mosquito previously fed on a person with a polyclonal infection.\nPolyclonal infections are the norm in high-transmission areas:\nSub-Saharan Africa: Mean COI = 2-5 clones per infection Southeast Asia: Mean COI = 1-2 clones per infection Low transmission areas: Mean COI ≈ 1 clone per infection The COI-Transmission Relationship COI is a powerful proxy for transmission intensity. Here\u0026rsquo;s why:\nIn high-transmission settings (many infected mosquitoes):\nPeople are bitten frequently by infected mosquitoes Each bite can introduce new clones (superinfection) COI accumulates over time → polyclonal infections are common In low-transmission settings (few infected mosquitoes):\nPeople are rarely bitten by infected mosquitoes Infections are typically from a single mosquito bite COI remains low → monoclonal infections dominate This relationship is so strong that epidemiologists use COI as a molecular marker of transmission intensity—even in the absence of direct entomological data (mosquito counts, biting rates, etc.).\nReal-World Example: DRC Malaria Study In our nationwide study of malaria in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we found dramatic geographic variation in COI:\nRegion Transmission Intensity Mean COI % Polyclonal Kinshasa (urban, low) Low 1.2 18% Eastern highlands Moderate 2.1 65% Western rainforest High 3.8 94% The gradient is striking: In low-transmission Kinshasa, most infections are monoclonal. In high-transmission rainforest regions, nearly everyone has multiple parasite clones.\nMeasuring COI: The Challenge Here\u0026rsquo;s the problem: You can\u0026rsquo;t just \u0026ldquo;count\u0026rdquo; parasite clones under a microscope. Genetically distinct clones look identical morphologically. You need molecular methods to distinguish them.\nThe key insight: Polyclonal infections contain mixtures of parasite DNA. When you sequence a blood sample with COI = 3, you\u0026rsquo;re sequencing DNA from three distinct parasite genomes simultaneously. The challenge is disentangling that mixture.\nThe Heterozygosity Signal The primary signal of polyclonal infection is within-host heterozygosity—the presence of multiple alleles at a single genetic locus within one host.\nConsider a single SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) in the parasite genome:\nMonoclonal infection (COI = 1):\nThe parasite has either allele A or allele T The host sample shows: 100% A or 100% T No within-host heterozygosity Polyclonal infection (COI = 3):\nClone 1 has allele A Clone 2 has allele A Clone 3 has allele T The host sample shows: 67% A, 33% T Within-host heterozygosity detected! By counting how many SNPs show within-host heterozygosity across the genome, we can estimate COI.\nMethod 1: THE REAL McCOIL THE REAL McCOIL (The Real McCoy method for Complexity Of Infection in Loci) is the most widely used COI estimation method. Developed by the EPPIcenter research group, it uses a probabilistic framework to estimate COI from SNP data.\nThe Coin Flip Analogy Think of each parasite clone as a coin flip:\nClone contributes allele A → Heads Clone contributes allele T → Tails For a SNP to be heterozygous, you need:\nAt least one \u0026ldquo;heads\u0026rdquo; (allele A) At least one \u0026ldquo;tails\u0026rdquo; (allele T) The probability of this happening depends on:\nCOI — More clones = more coin flips = higher chance of seeing both alleles Population allele frequency — If allele A is rare (10% frequency), seeing it requires more \u0026ldquo;flips\u0026rdquo; The McCOIL Model McCOIL uses a likelihood framework:\nP(heterozygous | COI, p) = 1 - p^COI - (1-p)^COI Where:\nCOI is the complexity of infection (what we\u0026rsquo;re estimating) p is the population-level allele frequency The equation says: \u0026ldquo;Probability of heterozygous = 1 minus (all clones have A) minus (all clones have T)\u0026rdquo; By observing heterozygous sites across many SNPs and knowing population allele frequencies, McCOIL uses maximum likelihood to estimate COI.\nWhy It Works The key insight: The number of heterozygous sites increases with COI, but saturates.\nCOI = 1: 0 heterozygous sites (impossible to have both alleles with one clone) COI = 2: ~20-30% of SNPs heterozygous (depends on allele frequencies) COI = 5: ~40-50% of SNPs heterozygous COI = 10: ~50-60% of SNPs heterozygous (saturation) McCOIL leverages this relationship to back-calculate COI from the observed heterozygosity pattern.\nMethod 2: F_WS (Within-Host Diversity) F_WS is an alternative approach that measures within-host diversity relative to population diversity.\nThe F-Statistic Framework F_WS is inspired by Wright\u0026rsquo;s F-statistics from population genetics:\nF_WS = 1 - (H_W / H_S) Where:\nH_W = within-host heterozygosity (average across SNPs in one sample) H_S = population heterozygosity (expected diversity in the population) Interpretation:\nF_WS = 1: Monoclonal infection (no within-host diversity) F_WS = 0: Polyclonal infection with diversity matching the population F_WS \u0026lt; 0: Polyclonal infection with higher diversity than the population (cotransmission of divergent clones) Why F_WS is Useful Unlike COI (a discrete count), F_WS is continuous. This makes it:\nMore stable with sparse data Better for detecting subtle changes in transmission Easier to model statistically (no integer constraints) However, F_WS doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you an exact clone count—it\u0026rsquo;s a relative measure of genetic complexity.\nComparing the Methods Feature THE REAL McCOIL F_WS Output Integer COI estimate Continuous diversity metric Interpretation Direct: \u0026ldquo;This person has 3 clones\u0026rdquo; Relative: \u0026ldquo;High within-host diversity\u0026rdquo; Data requirements Moderate (50-100 SNPs) Flexible (works with fewer SNPs) Sensitivity High for COI 1-5, saturates above Linear across all ranges Computational cost Moderate (likelihood optimization) Fast (simple calculation) Best use case When you need exact clone counts When comparing populations or tracking trends In practice, many researchers report both metrics to provide complementary information.\nWhy COI Matters for Malaria Control 1. Transmission Intensity Monitoring COI provides a molecular thermometer for transmission:\nIncreasing COI → transmission is rising Decreasing COI → interventions are working This is especially valuable when traditional surveillance (case counts, mosquito abundance) is unreliable.\nExample: After mass drug administration in Zambia, researchers tracked COI decline from 2.8 to 1.4 over two years—direct molecular evidence that transmission was being interrupted.\n2. Drug Resistance Surveillance Detecting resistance mutations is straightforward in monoclonal infections—you either have the mutation or you don\u0026rsquo;t. But polyclonal infections create ambiguity:\nScenario: A patient has COI = 4 with these clones:\nClone 1: Resistant (has mutation) Clone 2: Sensitive Clone 3: Sensitive Clone 4: Sensitive When you sequence this sample, you might detect the resistance mutation at 25% frequency. Is this:\nA monoclonal infection with partial resistance? A polyclonal infection where most clones are sensitive? The answer determines treatment strategy. COI estimation helps disentangle these scenarios.\n3. Vaccine Trial Interpretation In vaccine trials, polyclonal infections complicate efficacy estimates:\nDid the vaccine fail, or did it prevent 2 out of 3 clones? Is a breakthrough infection after vaccination less complex than natural infection? Tracking COI before and after vaccination provides deeper insights into vaccine mechanisms.\n4. Elimination Feasibility High COI indicates active, ongoing transmission—a major barrier to elimination. Before declaring an area ready for elimination efforts, COI surveillance ensures you\u0026rsquo;re not missing cryptic transmission.\nPractical Considerations Data Requirements To estimate COI, you need:\nSequencing data from blood samples (whole genome, amplicon, or targeted SNP panels) Population allele frequencies for the SNPs you\u0026rsquo;re analyzing Quality control to distinguish real heterozygosity from sequencing error Most modern studies use:\n50-200 high-quality SNPs Minimum read depth: 20-30× coverage per SNP Population reference panels from the same geographic region Technical Challenges Challenge 1: Sequencing Errors Low-frequency alleles might be errors, not real clones. Solution: Use stringent quality filters and higher coverage.\nChallenge 2: Unequal Clone Proportions If one clone is 90% of the infection and another is 10%, the minority clone is hard to detect. Solution: Deep sequencing and probabilistic modeling.\nChallenge 3: Population Allele Frequencies McCOIL requires accurate population frequencies. If you use wrong frequencies (e.g., from a different continent), COI estimates will be biased.\nWhat We\u0026rsquo;ve Learned From years of molecular surveillance, several patterns have emerged:\nCOI Declines with Age In high-transmission areas:\nChildren: Mean COI = 3-4 (frequent exposure, accumulating clones) Adults: Mean COI = 2-3 (semi-immunity reduces superinfection) This age gradient is a signature of acquired immunity shaping within-host parasite dynamics.\nCOI Tracks Seasonality In seasonal transmission zones, COI fluctuates:\nDry season (low transmission): COI drops to 1-2 Wet season (high transmission): COI rises to 3-5 This provides real-time feedback on transmission dynamics without waiting for case count data.\nCOI Differs by Intervention Mass drug administration drives COI down faster than insecticide-treated nets:\nMDA: COI drops within months (clears existing infections) ITNs: COI drops over years (reduces new infections gradually) This difference helps optimize intervention strategies.\nThe Future: Beyond Simple Counts Current research is pushing beyond simple COI estimates toward clone-level resolution:\nHaplotype-based methods use linkage patterns across multiple SNPs to:\nIdentify individual clone haplotypes Reconstruct cotransmission networks Track specific strains across time and space Machine learning approaches are being developed to:\nHandle low-coverage sequencing data Estimate COI from partial genomes Integrate multiple data types (SNPs, microsatellites, copy number variants) These advances will transform COI from a summary statistic into a window on parasite population structure at the finest resolution.\nThe Bottom Line Complexity of infection is a deceptively simple concept—just count the clones—that reveals profound insights into malaria transmission, drug resistance, and intervention effectiveness.\nBy measuring within-host genetic diversity, we transform each infected person into a sentinel for transmission intensity. COI provides a molecular lens on epidemiology that complements traditional surveillance and enables precision public health.\nAs malaria elimination efforts intensify, COI surveillance will be essential for:\nDetecting cryptic transmission Monitoring intervention impact Identifying resistance spread Guiding resource allocation The complexities of complexity of infection are worth mastering—because behind every statistic is a person, and behind every person is a network of transmission we\u0026rsquo;re working to interrupt.\nFurther Reading Key Papers:\nChang HH, et al.

Despite sophisticated models and massive computing power, predictions varied wildly. Some forecasts missed by orders of magnitude. A question that arose is does network structure even matter for prediction? If so, which features matter most?\nAfter analyzing 1.35 million epidemic simulations across 1,650 unique scenarios, we found surprising relationships.\nThe 45-Fold Difference The single most important finding from our research: Network heterogeneity—the presence of \u0026ldquo;hubs\u0026rdquo; with many contacts—improves epidemic predictability by up to 45-fold compared to networks where everyone has the same number of contacts.\nLet me put that in concrete terms:\nIn homogeneous networks (everyone has ~20 contacts): Our predictions were off by an average of 72 people in a population of 1,000. Prediction error: 7.2% In heterogeneous networks (some hubs, some regular people): Our predictions were off by just 3 people. Prediction error: 0.3% That\u0026rsquo;s not a marginal improvement. That\u0026rsquo;s the difference between a confident forecast and an educated guess.\nWhy Hubs Change Everything Degree distribution and heterogeneity are the \u0026ldquo;temperature and pressure\u0026rdquo; of epidemic prediction.\nOur research quantifies exactly how much each network feature matters:\nNetwork Feature Predictability (CV) Relative Impact Degree heterogeneity 0.287 Best (3× better than modularity) Clustering 0.577 Intermediate Temporal dynamics 0.806 Weak Modularity 0.822 Worst (3× worse than degree) CV (coefficient of variation) measures unpredictability—lower is more predictable. The 3-fold difference between degree heterogeneity and modularity tells us to prioritize measuring the right things.\nWhen Predictions Work (and When They Don\u0026rsquo;t) Not all epidemics are equally predictable. We found that predictability varies 18-fold depending on transmission characteristics:\nHighly Predictable Scenarios:\nHigh transmission rates (10% infection risk per contact per day) Long infectious periods (15 days) Heterogeneous networks with clear hubs Result: Prediction error \u0026lt; 1 person (0.1% of population) Essentially Random Scenarios:\nLow transmission rates (0.5% per contact per day) Short infectious periods (3 days) Modular or homogeneous networks Result: Prediction error \u0026gt; 100 people (10% of population) The 80-20 Rule of Disease Spread In heterogeneous networks, we consistently observed:\n20% of individuals (hubs) have 80% of contacts Those 20% cause ~80% of transmission events This is structural (determined by network position), not random This is a game-changer for intervention strategies. Vaccinating people randomly provides linear benefit: vaccinate 20% of people, prevent 20% of infections. But vaccinating the top 20% by degree prevents 60% of infections—three times the impact.\nThe challenge, of course, is identifying hubs. But that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what our research shows we should prioritize measuring.\nOne Million Simulations: The Computational Scale This is one of the largest systematic investigations of network effects on epidemics ever conducted:\n1.35 million stochastic epidemic simulations 1,650 unique parameter combinations 6 network manipulation types tested 25 transmission scenarios (5 rates × 5 durations) 100 replicates per scenario for statistical power 93 GB of simulation data analyzed We started with 10 baseline networks (1,000 people, 20 contacts each), then systematically manipulated:\nDegree Distribution — Created hubs with 80+ contacts using stick-breaking process Modularity — Built community structure (separate friend groups) Clustering — Added triangles (\u0026ldquo;friend-of-friend\u0026rdquo; connections) Unity — Broke down community barriers Dynamicity — Added temporal rewiring (people change contacts over time) Baseline — Control networks with no manipulation Each simulation ran a stochastic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model using the Gillespie algorithm for exact event-driven dynamics. We then compared predictions from Newman\u0026rsquo;s analytical framework against actual simulated outcomes.\nWhen Simple Math Beats Complex Simulations One of our most validating findings: Newman\u0026rsquo;s analytical predictions are remarkably accurate for heterogeneous networks.\nWhen degree variance is present:\nMean Absolute Error \u0026lt; 5 people (0.5% of population) Correlation between theory and simulation: r \u0026gt; 0.95 Works best at moderate-to-high transmission rates When degree variance is absent (homogeneous networks):\nMean Absolute Error \u0026gt; 50 people (5% of population) Theory and simulation diverge Even simulations show high variance across runs The pattern is striking: Newman\u0026rsquo;s accuracy inversely correlates with outcome unpredictability (r = -0.85, p \u0026lt; 0.01). When epidemics are inherently predictable (heterogeneous networks), simple analytical methods work beautifully. When epidemics are inherently random (homogeneous/modular networks), even complex simulations struggle.\nThis suggests a practical heuristic: If your analytical model is failing, it might not be because the model is wrong—it might be because the epidemic is genuinely unpredictable given available data.\nSurprising Finding: Network Dynamics Don\u0026rsquo;t Matter Much We expected temporal dynamics—people changing who they interact with over time—to strongly affect predictability. We were wrong.\nWhen node-level degrees stay constant:\nStatic networks: CV = 0.810 Dynamic networks (rewiring edges): CV = 0.806 Virtually no difference Implication: Static network snapshots may be sufficient for most epidemic models, as long as you accurately capture the degree distribution. You don\u0026rsquo;t need expensive longitudinal contact tracing if you can measure degree heterogeneity at a single point in time.\nThis is enormously practical. Longitudinal contact network data is expensive and invasive to collect. Our results suggest that investing in accurate degree measurements at one timepoint may be more valuable than tracking changing contacts over time.\nAbout the Research This work was conducted using custom-built simulation infrastructure implementing event-driven stochastic SIR models on structured contact networks.

However, I do enjoy competition and the opportunity to participate in a little \u0026ldquo;smack talk\u0026rdquo; with family and friends.\nEvery year, family, friends, and folks from my childhood community come together to play a game of NFL Pool Knockout. The rules are deceptively simple:\nEach participant picks one NFL team each week If your team wins, you advance to the next week If your team loses or ties, you\u0026rsquo;re eliminated Each team can only be selected once during the season Last person standing wins Sounds simple, right? The strategy, however, is surprisingly complex.\nThe Complexity Problem At first glance, you might think: \u0026ldquo;Just pick the best team each week!\u0026rdquo; But there\u0026rsquo;s a catch—once you use a team, you can\u0026rsquo;t use them again. This creates a classic resource allocation problem under uncertainty.\nConsider the mathematical scale:\n18 weeks in an NFL season 32 teams available Number of possible strategies: 18! ≈ 6.4 × 10¹⁵ That\u0026rsquo;s 6.4 quadrillion possible ways to order your picks. You can\u0026rsquo;t evaluate them all.\nThe Strategic Dilemma Should you:\nBurn your best teams early to guarantee survival through the early weeks? Save elite teams for late when fewer opponents remain? Balance risk across the season with a mix of safe and risky picks? The answer depends on:\nTeam strength — Who\u0026rsquo;s actually good? Schedule strength — Who do they play each week? Bye weeks — When are teams not playing? Opponent strategy — What are others likely to pick? Variance — How unpredictable are the outcomes? This is where statistics comes in.\nThe Statistical Approach I built an R package called nflKOSA (NFL Knockout Simulated Annealing) to solve this optimization problem. The package focuses on the core challenge: given win probabilities for each matchup, find the optimal sequence of team selections.\nSimulated Annealing Optimization Once we have win probabilities for every matchup, we need to find the optimal sequence of team selections across 18 weeks. This is a combinatorial optimization problem that\u0026rsquo;s too large for brute force.\nSimulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by metallurgy (the process of slowly cooling metal to minimize defects). Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works:\nStart with a random strategy (sequence of team picks) Calculate the \u0026ldquo;energy\u0026rdquo; (expected number of weeks survived) Propose a small change (swap two team selections) If the new strategy is better, accept it If the new strategy is worse, sometimes accept it anyway (with probability based on \u0026ldquo;temperature\u0026rdquo;) Slowly reduce the \u0026ldquo;temperature\u0026rdquo; to converge on an optimum The key insight: accepting worse solutions early prevents getting stuck in local optima. By occasionally accepting suboptimal moves, the algorithm can escape local peaks and find the global maximum.\nEvaluating Strategies Each strategy is evaluated by calculating the expected weeks survived. For a given sequence of team picks, this is:\nExpected Weeks = Σ P(survive to week w) = Σ Π(win probability for weeks 1 through w) The simulated annealing algorithm maximizes this objective by:\nStarting with a random team selection sequence Using the cost() function to evaluate the strategy (negative expected weeks) Using the proposal() function to generate alternative strategies Accepting improvements and occasionally accepting worse solutions Cooling the temperature parameter to converge on the optimum The optimization returns:\nOptimal team sequence — Which team to pick each week Expected survival — Based on the product of win probabilities Final cost — Negative expected weeks survived Post drafted with assistance from Claude.AI\n","date":1731456000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1731456000,"objectID":"b8ec569aeac56ac37e7be36a68d05551","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/2024/11/13/using-statistical-modeling-to-win-a-nfl-knockout-pool/","publishdate":"2024-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2024/11/13/using-statistical-modeling-to-win-a-nfl-knockout-pool/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction Admittedly, I am a terrible sports fan.

By theory, genetic relatnedness is strictly limited to measure of identity by descent. For a full mathematical overview of the simple model, please see the supplements from Brazeau et al. 2022 in in preperation1.\nBriefly, in the early 1970s, Malécot described a relationship between genetic relatedness and physical distance under the premise that pairs that are far apart are less likely to mate: isolation by distance. Capitalizing on this framework by using measures of identity by descent (IBD), we produce a deme inbreeding spatial coefficient (DISC) for point process data in continuous space. Essentially, this measure estimates the amount of \u0026ldquo;inbreeding\u0026rdquo; or within deme relatedness under the assumption that relatedness between two locations in space can be measured from the average pairwise IBD between those two locations conditional on the physical distance that separates them. Further, we assume that geographic distance is scaled by a migration rate, which is a global parameter among all spatial locations (i.e. the migration rate is assumed to be constant through space). As a result, the model produces a DISC for each spatial location considered (user defined) and an overall migration rate parameter (m). Parameter optimization is achieved with a \u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo; gradient descent algorithm. Given that \u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo; gradient descent is used, we recommend running numerous models from a wide of array of start parameters to ensure that your final results are the global maximum and not a local maximum (i.e. a false peak).\nNicholas F Brazeau, in preparation.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":1646838020,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646838020,"objectID":"329bb339a90b83192e88affa5733cbdf","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/project/discent/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T08:00:20-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/discent/","section":"project","summary":"An algorithm for detecting deme inbreeding spatial coefficients from recombining pathogen genetic data","tags":["rpackage","malaria","active"],"title":"`DISCent`: Spatial Inbreeding Estimation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

The age-specific IFR can be quantified using antibody surveys to estimate total infections, but requires consideration of delay-distributions from time from infection to seroconversion, time to death, and time to seroreversion (i.e. antibody waning) alongside serologic test sensitivity and specificity. Previous IFR estimates have not fully propagated uncertainty or accounted for these potential biases, particularly seroreversion. Methods: We built a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates these factors and applied this model to simulated data and 10 serologic studies from different countries. Results: We demonstrate that seroreversion becomes a crucial factor as time accrues but is less important during first-wave, short-term dynamics. We additionally show that disaggregating surveys by regions with higher versus lower disease burden can inform serologic test specificity estimates. The overall IFR in each setting was estimated at 0.49-2.53%. Conclusion: We developed a robust statistical framework to account for full uncertainties in the parameters determining IFR. We provide code for others to apply these methods to further datasets and future epidemics.","tags":["Computational biology and bioinformatics","Respiratory tract diseases"],"title":"Estimating the COVID-19 infection fatality ratio accounting for seroreversion using statistical modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cedar L.

Ensuring access to care, irrespective of COVID-19 status, in winter 2020-2021 is essential. METHODS: An integrated model of hospital capacity planning and epidemiological projections of COVID-19 patients is used to estimate the demand for and resultant spare capacity of ICU beds, staff and ventilators under different epidemic scenarios in France, Germany and Italy across the 2020-2021 winter period. The effect of implementing lockdowns triggered by different numbers of COVID-19 patients in ICUs under varying levels of effectiveness is examined, using a 'dual-demand' (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) patient model. RESULTS: Without sufficient mitigation, we estimate that COVID-19 ICU patient numbers will exceed those seen in the first peak, resulting in substantial capacity deficits, with beds being consistently found to be the most constrained resource. Reactive lockdowns could lead to large improvements in ICU capacity during the winter season, with pressure being most effectively alleviated when lockdown is triggered early and sustained under a higher level of suppression. The success of such interventions also depends on baseline bed numbers and average non-COVID-19 patient occupancy. CONCLUSION: Reductions in capacity deficits under different scenarios must be weighed against the feasibility and drawbacks of further lockdowns. Careful, continuous decision-making by national policymakers will be required across the winter period 2020-2021.","tags":["Communicable Disease Control","COVID-19","epidemiological modelling","Europe","France","Germany","hospital capacity","Humans","intensive care","Intensive Care Units","Italy","non-pharmaceutical interventions","Pandemics","SARS-CoV-2"],"title":"Modelling intensive care unit capacity under different epidemiological scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic in three Western European countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

Despite this growing body of evidence, no nationally representative epidemiological surveys of P. vivax in sub-Saharan Africa have been performed. To overcome this gap in knowledge, we screened over 17,000 adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for P. vivax using samples from the 2013-2014 Demographic Health Survey. Overall, we found a 2.97% (95% CI: 2.28%, 3.65%) prevalence of P. vivax infections across the DRC. Infections were associated with few risk-factors and demonstrated a relatively flat distribution of prevalence across space with focal regions of relatively higher prevalence in the north and northeast. Mitochondrial genomes suggested that DRC P. vivax were distinct from circulating non-human ape strains and an ancestral European P. vivax strain, and instead may be part of a separate contemporary clade. Our findings suggest P. vivax is diffusely spread across the DRC at a low prevalence, which may be associated with long-term carriage of low parasitemia, frequent relapses, or a general pool of infections with limited forward propagation.","tags":["Adolescent","Adult","Age Factors","Carrier State","Cross-Sectional Studies","Democratic Republic of the Congo","Female","Humans","Malaria","Vivax","Male","Mass Screening","Parasitemia","Plasmodium vivax","Prevalence","Risk Factors","Young Adult"],"title":"The epidemiology of Plasmodium vivax among adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Molly Deutsch-Feldman","Jonathan B.

In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island. METHODS: We used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine rollout. RESULTS: C19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact.","tags":["COVID-19","COVID-19 Vaccines","Humans","Immunization Programs","Indonesia","Modelling","Non-pharmaceutical interventions","SARS-CoV-2","Surveillance","Syndrome","Vaccination","Vaccinations"],"title":"Using syndromic measures of mortality to capture the dynamics of COVID-19 in Java, Indonesia, in the context of vaccination rollout","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra B.

However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extend a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identify optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We find that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for textless 20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.","tags":["Aged","COVID-19","COVID-19 Vaccines","Humans","Mathematical model","Models","Theoretical","Optimisation","Public Health","SARS-CoV-2","Vaccination","Vaccination model","Vaccines"],"title":"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: A mathematical modelling analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oliver J.

Little is known about the distribution of ovale malaria and risk factors for infection in areas of high malaria endemicity. METHODS: Using the 2013 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Demographic and Health Survey, we conducted a risk factor analysis for P. ovale infections. We evaluated geographic clustering of infections and speciated to P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri through deep sequencing. RESULTS: Of 18 149 adults tested, we detected 143 prevalent P. ovale infections (prevalence estimate 0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], .59%-.98%). Prevalence ratios (PR) for significant risk factors were: male sex PR = 2.12 (95% CI, 1.38-3.26), coprevalent P. falciparum PR = 3.52 (95% CI, 2.06-5.99), and rural residence PR = 2.19 (95% CI, 1.31-3.66). P. ovale was broadly distributed throughout the DRC; an elevated cluster of infections was detected in the south-central region. Speciation revealed P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri circulating throughout the country. CONCLUSIONS: P. ovale persists broadly in the DRC, a high malaria burden country. For successful elimination of all malaria species, P. ovale needs to be on the radar of malaria control programs.","tags":["Adult","amplicon sequencing","Democratic Republic of the Congo","epidemiology","Humans","Malaria","nonfalciparum malaria","Plasmodium ovale","Prevalence"],"title":"Under the Radar: Epidemiology of Plasmodium ovale in the Democratic Republic of the Congo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pierre Nouvellet","Sangeeta Bhatia","Anne Cori","Kylie E.

Mobility data represent an important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27-77%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49-91%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12-48%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial.","tags":["Algorithms","Communicable Disease Control","COVID-19","Global Health","Humans","Models","Theoretical","Pandemics","Physical Distancing","Quarantine","SARS-CoV-2"],"title":"Reduction in mobility and COVID-19 transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica T.

METHODS: From mid-January to March 2020, we extracted publicly available data regarding the spread and control of COVID-19 from 31 provincial health authorities and major media outlets in mainland China. Based on these data, we conducted descriptive analyses of the epidemic in the six most-affected provinces. RESULTS: School closures, travel restrictions, community-level lockdown, and contact tracing were introduced concurrently around late January but subsequent epidemic trends differed among provinces. Compared with Hubei, the other five most-affected provinces reported a lower crude case fatality ratio and proportion of critical and severe hospitalised cases. From March 2020, as the local transmission of COVID-19 declined, switching the focus of measures to the testing and quarantine of inbound travellers may have helped to sustain the control of the epidemic.

A publicly available database containing these indicators and information regarding control measures is a useful resource for further research and policy planning in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.","tags":["Case fatality ratio","China","Contact","Contact Tracing","Control measure","COVID-19","Databases","Factual","Epidemic","Humans","SARS-CoV-2"],"title":"Database of epidemic trends and control measures during the first wave of COVID-19 in mainland China","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["modeling"],"content":" Talk at the UNC Institute of Global Health and Infectious Disease monthly conference.

We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. FINDINGS: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. INTERPRETATION: Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges.

We jointly model the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework.

We estimate that Rt was only below one in 23 states on 1st June. We also estimate that 3.7% [3.4%-4.0%] of the total population of the US had been infected, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious.

The model was originally designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (hence the name) but is broadly applicable. Accurate inference of the IFR based on serological data is challenging due to a number of factors that can bias estimates away from the true value, including: (1) the delay between infection and death, (2) the dynamical process of seroconversion and seroreversion, (3) potential differences in age-specific attack rates, and (4) serological test characteristics. These delay-distributions and serologic test characteristics are expected to cause both shifts in when deaths are observed as well as when and how many true infections are observed, which will then affect the IFR. The model used in COVIDCurve can be briefly summarized as having two pieces: (1) an infection curve shape that is informed by the shape the of the observed death curve but \u0026ldquo;thrown\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot; backwards in time; (2) a pin or a point on the y-axis that the shape must go through (i.e. a pin to inform the area under the curve, or cumulative infections). This pin is informed by the observed serologic data, accounting for test characteristics (e.g. sensitivity and specificity) as well as the time from infection to seroconversion and seroreversion. Accounting for seroreversion, or the waning of antibodies over time that then produces a false negative test, becomes increasingly important as epidemics progress and/or as daily infections start to contract.\nThe IFR estimates from this model (code repo) were published as Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team Report 341.

This has led to substantial interest in their \\\"test, trace, isolate\\\" strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities of South Korea's outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to emulate these measures elsewhere. METHODS: We systematically extracted numbers of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases, and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using an established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government sources. RESULTS: We estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, Rt dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI, 1.64-2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June, Rt was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th). Despite less stringent \\\"lockdown\\\" measures, strong social distancing measures were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased, and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly; however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to be important for South Korea's successful outbreak control, other factors including regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed. The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases that are linked to clusters may be more difficult.","tags":["Bayes Theorem","Betacoronavirus","Clinical Laboratory Techniques","Contact tracing","Contact Tracing","Coronavirus Infections","COVID-19","COVID-19 Testing","Disease Outbreaks","Humans","Pandemics","Pneumonia","Viral","Public health interventions","Quarantine","Reproduction number","Republic of Korea","SARS-CoV-2","South Korea"],"title":"Response to COVID-19 in South Korea and implications for lifting stringent interventions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra B.

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. METHODS: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3·0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics.

In this study, we assessed malaria risk factors among adults using samples from the nationally representative, cross-sectional 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We further explored differences in risk factors by urbanicity. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum infection was determined by PCR. Covariates were drawn from the DHS to model individual, community and environmental-level risk factors for infection. Additionally, we used deep sequencing data to estimate the community-level proportions of drug-resistant infections and included these estimates as potential risk factors. All identified factors were assessed for differences in associations by urbanicity. RESULTS: A total of 16 126 adults were included. Overall prevalence of malaria was 30.3% (SE=1.1) by PCR; province-level prevalence ranged from 6.7% to 58.3%. Only 17% of individuals lived in households with at least one bed-net for every two people, as recommended by the WHO. Protective factors included increasing within-household bed-net coverage (Prevalence Ratio=0.85, 95% CI=0.76-0.95) and modern housing (PR=0.58, 95% CI=0.49-0.69). Community-level protective factors included increased median wealth (PR=0.87, 95% CI=0.83-0.92). Education, wealth, and modern housing showed protective associations in cities but not in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The DRC continues to suffer from a high burden of malaria; interventions that target high-risk groups and sustained investment in malaria control are sorely needed. Areas of high prevalence should be prioritised for interventions to target the largest reservoirs for further transmission.","tags":["Adult","Cross-Sectional Studies","cross-sectional survey","Democratic Republic of the Congo","epidemiology","Humans","malaria","Malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","PCR","Plasmodium falciparum"],"title":"Spatial and epidemiological drivers of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["r"],"content":"The goal of polySimIBD is to perform forwards in-time simulation of malaria population genetics.

Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths. Results: We show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister's announcement of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility. Conclusions: These analyses form a baseline from which to observe changes in behaviour in the UK as social distancing is eased and inform policy towards the future control of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK.","tags":["Covid-19","Mobile Phone","Mobility","SARS-CoV-2","United Kingdom"],"title":"Anonymised and aggregated crowd level mobility data from mobile phones suggests that initial compliance with COVID-19 social distancing interventions was high and geographically consistent across the UK","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

Despite consistent implementation of effective tools since 2002, elimination has not been achieved. Importation of parasites from outside of the archipelago is thought to be an important cause of malaria's persistence, but this paradigm has not been studied using modern genetic tools. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate the impact of importation, employing population genetic analyses of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from both the archipelago and mainland Tanzania. Ancestry, levels of genetic diversity and differentiation, patterns of relatedness, and patterns of selection between these two populations were assessed by leveraging recent advances in deconvolution of genomes from polyclonal malaria infections. RESULTS: Significant decreases in the effective population sizes were inferred in both populations that coincide with a period of decreasing malaria transmission in Tanzania. Identity by descent analysis showed that parasites in the two populations shared long segments of their genomes, on the order of 5 cM, suggesting shared ancestry within the last 10 generations. Even with limited sampling, two of isolates between the mainland and Zanzibar were identified that are related at the expected level of half-siblings, consistent with recent importation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that importation plays an important role for malaria incidence on Zanzibar and demonstrate the value of genomic approaches for identifying corridors of parasite movement to the island.","tags":["Cohort Studies","Demography","Gene Library","Genetic Variation","Haploidy","Haplotypes","Humans","Incidence","Islands","Malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","Mutation","Plasmodium","Plasmodium falciparum","Population genetics","Tanzania","Travel","Whole Genome Sequencing"],"title":"Falciparum malaria from coastal Tanzania and Zanzibar remains highly connected despite effective control efforts on the archipelago","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

Diminished susceptibility to DAP is emerging among Staphylococcus epidermidis strains although mechanisms for non-susceptibility (NS) remain poorly understood. We report a case of persistent S. epidermidis bacteremia in which loss of DAP susceptibility arose during prolonged treatment. Whole genome sequencing identified two mutations, Q371del and P415L, in a single-affected gene, WalK, that coincided with the emergence of DAP-NS. Protein modeling of the mutations predicted a disruption of WalK protein configuration. The emergence of mutations in a single-gene during DAP exposure raises concerns in an era of increasingly treatment-resistant infections. Lay summary: Daptomycin is an important antibiotic for fighting Staphylococcus infections. We identified variants in the WalK gene that were coincident with resistance in a clinical Staphylococcus epidermidis infection. Clinicians, hospital epidemiologists, and microbiology laboratories need to be aware of the potential for the evolution of drug resistance during prolonged daptomycin therapy.","tags":["antibiotic resistance","daptomycin","Staphylococcus epidermidis"],"title":"Loss of daptomycin susceptibility in clinical Staphylococcus epidermidis infection coincided with variants in WalK","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica T.

Using samples collected from five therapeutic efficacy studies conducted in 2007-11, we evaluated the prevalence of putative drug resistance mutations in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, and kelch13 genes at the time of those studies, as well as the ama1 gene for genetic relatedness using a pooled amplicon deep sequencing approach. Among all sites, the kelch13 gene showed no mutations, whereas the pfcrt CVIET genotype was fixed in all populations. By contrast, the mdr1 gene demonstrated frequencies of resistant genotypes ranging from 10 to 100% at amino acid position 86 and from 0% to 57.8% at amino acid position 1246. Although we observed a low degree of haplotype sharing between sites, we did observe considerable haplotype sharing within sites over time. This suggests that P. falciparum populations in Ethiopia are isolated and able to persist through time.","tags":["Antimalarials","DNA","Protozoan","Drug Resistance","Ethiopia","Gene Expression Regulation","Haplotypes","High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing","Humans","Malaria","Falciparum","Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins","Mutation","Plasmodium falciparum"],"title":"Pooled Deep Sequencing of Drug Resistance Loci from Plasmodium falciparum Parasites across Ethiopia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ross M.

This study explores longitudinal changes in spatial patterns to understand how resistant malaria may be spreading within the DRC, using samples from nation-wide population-representative surveys. METHODS: We selected 552 children with PCR-detectable Plasmodium falciparum infection and identified known variants in the pfdhps and pfcrt genes associated with resistance. We compared the proportion of mutant parasites in 2013 to those previously reported from adults in 2007, and identified risk factors for carrying a resistant allele using multivariate mixed-effects modeling. Finally, we fit a spatial-temporal model to the observed data, providing smooth allele frequency estimates over space and time. RESULTS: The proportion of co-occurring pfdhps K540E/A581G mutations increased by 16% between 2007 and 2013. The spatial-temporal model suggests that the spatial range of the pfdhps double mutants expanded over time, while the prevalence and range of pfcrt mutations remained steady. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses population-representative samples to describe the changing landscape of SP resistance within the DRC, and the persistence of chloroquine resistance. Vigilant molecular surveillance is critical for controlling the spread of resistance.","tags":["Adolescent","Adult","Alcohol Dehydrogenase","Antimalarials","Chloroquine","Cross-Sectional Studies","Democratic Republic of the Congo","Drug Combinations","Drug resistance","Drug Resistance","Gene Frequency","Humans","Longitudinal Studies","Malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","Membrane Transport Proteins","Middle Aged","Mutation","Plasmodium falciparum","Prevalence","Protozoan Proteins","Pyrimethamine","Spatial-temporal modeling","Spatio-Temporal Analysis","Sulfadoxine","Young Adult"],"title":"The changing landscape of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance in the Democratic Republic of Congo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juliana M.

Four P. vivax infections were identified by polymerase chain reaction, each in a geographically different survey cluster. Using these as index cases, we tested the remaining 73 samples from the four clusters. With this approach, 10 confirmed cases, three probable cases, and one possible case of P. vivax were identified. Among the 14 P. vivax cases, nine were coinfected with Plasmodium falciparum. All 14 individuals were confirmed to be Duffy-negative by sequencing for the single point mutation in the GATA motif that represses the expression of the Duffy antigen. This finding is consistent with a growing body of literature that suggests that P. vivax can infect Duffy-negative individuals in Africa.

Shared medical appointments (SMA) have been shown to improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the SMA model could be adapted for a non-profit clinic in North Carolina that serves uninsured patients with diabetes that have incomes at/below 150% of the federal poverty line. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We implemented and sustained a patient-driven, student-led SMA model that incorporated the monthly rotations of students, physician assistant, and undergraduate students as well as pharmacy residents and an endocrinologist who collectively provide diabetes care at the free clinic. SMA groups are 'open' cohorts and include 4-12 patients scheduled for the monthly clinic. Teams of transdisciplinary trainees work together to perform triage, medication reconciliation, brief history, and physical exam, after which patients participate in the SMA. The endocrinologist evaluates SMA patients individually during and after the visit. RESULTS: Between November 2015 and January 2017, we enrolled 29 patients in SMA. There was high variability in HbA1c at baseline. Among eight type 2 diabetes patients seen in endocrine clinic and with complete data one year before and after SMA implementation, the mean (SD) HbA1c before SMA was 9.7% ± 1.7% (83±7 mmol/ mol); mean HbA1c after SMA was 9.2% ± 1.8% (77 ± 8mmol/mol). The median HbA1c before SMA was 9.5% (80 mmol/mol); median HbA1c after SMA was 8.9% (74 mmol/mol). Overall, 6/8 patients showed decreased HbA1c after SMA although there was variability between individuals in response of glycemic control to SMA. SMA increased clinic efficiency and offered an opportunity to integrate transdisciplinary trainees. Trainees gain experience with novel models of care and the complexities of the patient experience of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: We hope this observation encourages others to implement such programs to enhance the evidence-base for SMA to address health disparities and increase the quality of free diabetes care.","tags":["Free clinic","Interdisciplinary","Shared medical appointments","Type 2 diabetes"],"title":"Implementation and Evaluation of Shared Medical Appointments for Type 2 Diabetes at a Free, Student-Run Clinic in Alamance County, North Carolina","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["vivax","genomics"],"content":" Oral presentation at the annual American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conference analyzing the genomics of P. vivax relapses from Cambodia.\n","date":1510156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510156800,"objectID":"23493912b397aecc1270748bb2e356fd","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/talk/pvrelapse-astmh/","publishdate":"2020-12-18T08:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/pvrelapse-astmh/","section":"talk","summary":"Oral presentation at the annual American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conference analyzing the genomics of P. vivax relapses from Cambodia.","tags":["malaria"],"title":"Whole Genome Analysis of Polyclonal Plasmodium vivax Relapses in Cambodia","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Christian M.

Understanding this evolution can inform the deployment of new therapies. We investigated the genetic architecture of 78 falciparum isolates using whole-genome sequencing, correlating results to in vivo and ex vivo drug resistance and exploring the relationship between population structure, demographic history, and partner drug resistance. Principle component analysis, network analysis and demographic inference identified a diverse central population with three clusters of clonally expanding parasite populations, each associated with specific K13 artemisinin resistance alleles and partner drug resistance profiles which were consistent with the sequential deployment of artemisinin combination therapies in the region. One cluster displayed ex vivo piperaquine resistance and mefloquine sensitivity with a high rate of in vivo failure of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Another cluster displayed ex vivo mefloquine resistance and piperaquine sensitivity with high in vivo efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The final cluster was clonal and displayed intermediate sensitivity to both drugs. Variations in recently described piperaquine resistance markers did not explain the difference in mean IC90 or clinical failures between the high and intermediate piperaquine resistance groups, suggesting additional loci may be involved in resistance. The results highlight an important role for partner drug resistance in shaping the P. falciparum genetic landscape in Southeast Asia and suggest that further work is needed to evaluate for other mutations that drive piperaquine resistance.","tags":["ACT","Adult","Antipruritics","Artemisinins","Cambodia","drug resistance","Drug Resistance","ex vivo susceptibility","Female","Humans","kelch","malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","Male","mefloquine","Mefloquine","partner drug","pfmdr1","Phylogeny","piperaquine","plasmodium","Plasmodium falciparum","population genetics","Protozoan Proteins","Quinolines","Treatment Failure"],"title":"Partner-Drug Resistance and Population Substructuring of Artemisinin-Resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

Palm-to-palm clasping (PPC) is a distinct style of high-arm grooming in which the grooming partners clasp each other's raised palms. In wild communities, samples of at least 100 observed dyads grooming with raised hands showed PPC frequencies varying from textless5% (M group, Mahale) to textgreater30% dyads grooming (Kanyawara, Kibale), and in a large free-ranging sanctuary group, the frequency reached textgreater80% dyads (group 1, Chimfunshi) [1, 2]. Because between-community differences in frequency of PPC apparently result from social learning, are stable across generations, and last for at least 9 years, they are thought to be cultural, but the mechanism of transmission is unknown [2]. Here, we examine factors responsible for individual variation in PPC frequency within a single wild community. We found that in the Kanyawara community (Kibale, Uganda), adults of both sexes varied widely in their PPC frequency (from textless10% to textgreater50%) and did not converge on a central group tendency. However, frequencies of PPC were highly consistent within matrilines, indicating that individuals maintained lifelong fidelity to the grooming style of their mothers. Matrilineal inheritance of socially learned behaviors has previously been reported for tool use in chimpanzees [3] and in the vocal and feeding behavior of cetaceans [4, 5]. Our evidence indicates that matrilineal inheritance can be sufficiently strong in nonhuman primates to account for long-term differences in community traditions.","tags":["Animals","behavioral diffusion","conformity","conservatism","Female","Grooming","hand-clasp grooming","high-arm grooming","Male","palm-to-palm clasp","Pan troglodytes","Social Behavior","Social Learning","social tradition","transmission bias","Uganda"],"title":"Distribution of a Chimpanzee Social Custom Is Explained by Matrilineal Relationship Rather Than Conformity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

However, recent studies of wild ape dentitions have cast doubt on the use of developmental standards derived from captive individuals. Others have called into question the use of deceased wild individuals to infer normative development. We conducted a high resolution photographic study of living known-age subadults in the Kanyawara community (Kibale National Park, Uganda) to generate a comprehensive three year record of dental eruption (including tooth emergence ages). These non-invasive data allow comparisons of captive and wild chimpanzees, establish accurate developmental standards for relatively healthy wild individuals, and facilitate direct assessments of primate-wide associations between dental development and life history. Emergence ages in the Kanyawara chimpanzees are very similar to living Gombe chimpanzees, and are broadly comparable to deceased Taï Forest chimpanzees. Early-emerging teeth such as the deciduous dentition and first molar (M1) appear during a time of maternal dependence, and are almost indistinguishable from captive chimpanzee emergence ages, while later forming teeth in the Kanyawara population emerge in the latter half of captive age ranges or beyond. Five juveniles whose lower M1s emerged by or before 3.3 years of age continued to nurse for a year or more beyond M1 emergence, and their mothers showed considerable variation in reproductive rates. The third molars of two adolescent females emerged several months to several years prior to the birth of their first offspring. Given that broad primate-wide relationships between molar emergence and life history do not necessarily hold within this population of chimpanzees, particularly for variables that are reported to be coincident with molar emergence, we suggest that further study is required in order to predict life history variables in hominins or hominoids.","tags":["Adaptation","Physiological","Africa","Eastern","Aging","Animals","Biological Evolution","Dental development","Female","Human evolution","Life history","Male","Molar","Pan troglodytes","Tooth emergence","Tooth Eruption","Weaning"],"title":"Dental eruption in East African wild chimpanzees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

With advances in technology and treatment strategies, the clinical outcomes of CLI patients have significantly improved over recent years. However, despite progress, patency rates of both surgical and endovascular interventions, limb-salvage and amputation rates are still dismal. We review the epidemiology, treatment strategies, imaging modalities, and the microcirculation aspect of CLI.","tags":["Diagnostic Imaging","Endovascular Procedures","Humans","Lower Extremity","Microcirculation","Peripheral Arterial Disease","Radiology","Interventional","Risk Factors","Vascular Patency"],"title":"Critical limb ischemia: an update for interventional radiologists","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

However, despite this association, the mechanism by which compression produces these lesions is unknown. Diagnostic accuracy of MTS is critical since it often afflicts young patients requiring endovascular management. This review will focus on the historical, embryological and evolutionary description of MTS and examine its development, diagnosis, clinical management and potential diagnostic errors.","tags":["Endovascular Procedures","History","19th Century","History","20th Century","History","21st Century","Humans","May-Thurner Syndrome","Predictive Value of Tests","Risk Factors","Treatment Outcome","Vascular Surgical Procedures","Vena Cava Filters"],"title":"May-Thurner syndrome: diagnosis and management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shaunagh McDermott","George Oliveira","Emel Ergül","Nicholas Brazeau","Stephan Wicky","Rahmi Oklu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1359676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659209739,"objectID":"c53daea60cca9d564c99bb1dc08ade78","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/publication/mcdermott-may-thurner-2013/","publishdate":"2022-07-30T19:35:39.053237Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mcdermott-may-thurner-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the longitudinal stability of left common iliac vein (LCIV) compression by the right common iliac artery on magnetic resonance venography (MRV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 214 patients diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome by MRV. We identified a subset of patients who underwent contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging of the pelvis six months before or anytime after the MRV and did not undergo any interventional venous procedures between the two studies; 36 patients met these criteria. The degree of venous compression was calculated in both the index and comparison study. RESULTS: On the index MRV, the mean compression of the LCIV was 62%. However, on the comparison study in the same patients, the mean compression was 39%. The mean change in degree of compression between the two studies was 23% (P textless 0.0001), ranging from a 12% increase to 69% decrease in degree of compression on the comparison study. CONCLUSION: The compressed LCIV on a single MRV study was not stable over time and thus may be insufficient to diagnose May-Thurner syndrome.","tags":["Adult","Aged","Aged","80 and over","Diagnosis","Differential","Female","Humans","Iliac Artery","Iliac Vein","Magnetic Resonance Angiography","Male","May-Thurner Syndrome","Middle Aged","Phlebography","Reproducibility of Results","Retrospective Studies","Tomography","X-Ray Computed","Young Adult"],"title":"May-Thurner syndrome: can it be diagnosed by a single MR venography study?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"About Me","tags":null,"title":"About Me","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"About Me","tags":null,"title":"About Me","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0303e63affd8dc07a317967f663a59aa","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/consulting/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/consulting/","section":"","summary":"Consulting","tags":null,"title":"Consulting","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"23d1e75f872528fc12f5f2b142375ff7","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/publications/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/","section":"","summary":"Research items","tags":null,"title":"Products","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Projects","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0683f5804634b3020a9e3219fd1f3789","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/service/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/service/","section":"","summary":"Service and educational efforts","tags":null,"title":"Service","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":[],"categories":["r"],"content":"Briefly, the primary objective of this project was to identify methods that disrupt and/or enhance the predictability of infectious disease dynamics (IDD) of emerging outbreaks. We specifically focused on the variation in final sizes (total number of infected individuals) due to differences in contact networks, with plans to extend our framework as incidence over time versus focusing solely on the epidemic final siz]. Our focus on contact networks is based on the assumption that transmission parameters can be readily measured early in an epidemic. As a result, while contact patterns are difficult to measure, they are the pragmatic force driving uncertainty in the predictions of outbreak sizes. We also were interested in using a variation of a GAN approach to train a \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo; CNN (connected to a fully connected FFNN) prediction model that \u0026ldquo;fought\u0026rdquo; with a VAE demon model.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"291e3248f7b0c956d35bd04190509807","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/project/pipp/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pipp/","section":"project","summary":"Improving Pandemic Prediction using agent-based models and deep-neural networks","tags":["artificial intelligence","pathogens","active"],"title":"What Makes Pandemic Prediction Difficult?","type":"project"}]
